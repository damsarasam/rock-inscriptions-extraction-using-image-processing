# Rock Inscription Extraction using OpenCV

Welcome to the Rock Inscription Extraction project! This repository utilizes image processing techniques with OpenCV to extract and enhance rock inscriptions from photographs. By applying filters, edge detection, and contour analysis, the software identifies and isolates inscriptions, making them clearer and easier to study.

## Features

- **Image Processing Techniques:** Utilize various image processing techniques such as filters, edge detection, and contour analysis.
- **Inscription Identification:** Identify and isolate rock inscriptions from photographs.
- **Enhancement:** Enhance the clarity of inscriptions for better study and analysis.
- **Ideal for Archaeologists and Historians:** This project is tailored to meet the needs of archaeologists and historians for digital documentation and analysis of rock engravings.
